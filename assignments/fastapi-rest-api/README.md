# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to build and test RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. Students will create endpoints, handle requests, and return JSON responses.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1: Set Up FastAPI Project

#### Description
Set up a new Python project and install FastAPI. Create a basic FastAPI application with a root endpoint (`/`).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Create a main application file (e.g., `main.py`)
- Define a root endpoint that returns a welcome message

### 🛠️ Task 2: Create REST Endpoints

#### Description
Add endpoints for basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for a resource (e.g., items or users).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Define endpoints for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Return appropriate JSON responses

### 🛠️ Task 3: Test Your API

#### Description
Test your API using a tool like curl, HTTPie, or the FastAPI interactive docs (Swagger UI).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Demonstrate how to run the API server
- Show example requests and responses
- Ensure all endpoints work as expected
